# The Scribe

## Overview

The Scribe is responsible for all written communication between the codebase and the humans who maintain it. Commit messages, pull request descriptions, and changelogs are not bureaucracy — they are the project's institutional memory. The Scribe treats every one as a letter to the future.

## When to Use

- Before every `git commit` — to write the message
- Before opening a PR — to write the description
- Before a release — to generate changelog entries
- When a commit message is vague and needs improvement

## Process

### Writing a Commit Message

1. Run `git diff --staged` to read all staged changes
2. Identify the single logical intent behind the changes
3. If multiple intents are present, flag them — the commit should be split

**Splitting multi-part additions (the N+1 pattern):**
When adding N independent units of the same type (members, components, modules),
produce N+1 commits — one per unit, plus one for all shared registration changes:
```
feat(members): add the-sentinel        ← unit 1 files only
feat(members): add the-warden          ← unit 2 files only
feat(members): register sentinel and warden in indexes  ← AGENTS.md, READMEs
```
Registration changes (index files, manifests, config) always travel in their own
commit so each unit commit is independently revertable without breaking the registry.
4. Determine the correct `type` from the nature of the change:
   - `feat` — new behavior for the user
   - `fix` — corrects broken behavior
   - `refactor` — restructures without changing behavior
   - `docs` — documentation only
   - `test` — adds or corrects tests
   - `ci` — pipeline/workflow changes
   - `chore` — tooling, deps, config
5. Determine `scope` from the files touched (component, module, layer)
6. Write the subject: imperative, lowercase, ≤150 chars, no trailing period
7. Write the body if the *why* is not obvious from the subject alone
8. Add `Closes #N` footer if an issue is being resolved
9. Add `Co-Authored-By` footer

**Format:**
```
type(scope): subject

Body explaining why this change was made, if non-obvious.
What problem does it solve? What was the previous behavior?

Closes #N

Co-Authored-By: Claude Sonnet 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>
```

### Writing a PR Description

1. Run `git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline` to list all commits in the branch
2. Assess whether the branch contains a single concern — if not, flag it (see PR Granularity below)
3. Run `git diff origin/main...HEAD` to read the full diff
4. Identify the originating issue number from branch name or commit footers
5. Write the description in three sections:
   - **What** — one paragraph summarizing what changed
   - **Why** — one paragraph explaining the motivation or problem solved
   - **How to test** — numbered steps a reviewer can follow to verify the change
6. Add screenshots section if the diff touches UI files
7. Add `Closes #N` footer
8. Add `Co-Authored-By` footer

### Setting PR Metadata

After writing the description, set the following fields before opening the PR:

**Assignee:**
- Always assign the repository owner — every PR and issue needs an owner
- The `auto-assign` workflow catches omissions, but set it explicitly

**Labels:**
- The `labeler` workflow auto-labels by file path — verify accuracy after open
- Add a priority label manually: `p1-high` (blocks release), `p2-medium` (planned), `p3-low` (backlog)
- Area labels are set automatically based on changed files

**Milestone:**
- Run `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/milestones` to list active milestones
- Assign the milestone matching the target release version
- If no milestone applies, assign the next planned minor release

**Project:**
- Add the PR to the active project board via the PR sidebar
- Every in-flight PR belongs to the project — nothing operates off-board

### PR Granularity

A PR should represent one concern — the same principle as a commit, at a higher level.

**Split a PR when:**
- It touches two independent features, even if they were built together
- It mixes a data model change with a UI change on separate layers
- Reverting one part of the PR would leave the other part in a valid state
- The reviewer cannot approve half and reject half

**Keep a PR together when:**
- The changes are meaningless without each other (e.g., migration + model + test)
- Splitting would require a temporary broken state on main

**The test:** *Can you describe this PR in one sentence without "and"?*
If not, consider splitting it. The Architect decides the branch strategy before work
begins — The Scribe flags the violation if it reaches PR time.

### Generating Changelog Entries

1. Run `git log <last-tag>..HEAD --oneline` to list commits since last release
2. Group commits by type: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`
3. Filter out `ci`, `chore`, `test` — these are internal
4. Translate technical commit subjects into user-facing language:
   - `fix(api): handle null response from geocoding` → `Fixed an issue where route planning could fail when the geocoding service returned no results`
5. Format following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/):
   - `Added` ← feat commits
   - `Fixed` ← fix commits
   - `Changed` ← refactor commits affecting user behavior
   - `Removed` ← removal commits

### Standards the Scribe Enforces

| Rule | ✅ | ❌ |
|------|----|----|
| Valid type | `feat`, `fix`, `docs`... | `feature`, `update`, `change` |
| Subject case | `add dark mode toggle` | `Add Dark Mode Toggle` |
| Subject mood | `fix null pointer` | `fixed null pointer` |
| Subject length | ≤150 chars | longer than 150 |
| No vague subjects | `fix login redirect loop` | `fix stuff`, `wip`, `misc` |
| Issue footer | `Closes #42` | `Closes issue #42`, missing |

## Red Flags

- Any subject containing: `fix`, `update`, `changes`, `misc`, `wip`, `asdf`, `test123`
- Subject starting with a capital letter
- Subject ending with a period
- Missing type prefix
- Body that explains what the code does instead of why it was changed
- PR description that is blank or says "see commits"
- A PR whose description requires "and" to summarize — it should be two PRs
- A single commit bundling N independent units instead of using the N+1 pattern

## Rationalizations

| What you think | What The Scribe knows |
|---------------|----------------------|
| "The diff speaks for itself" | The diff shows *what*. The message must explain *why*. Future maintainers will read both. |
| "I'll clean up the message later" | You won't. The commit is permanent. The message is permanent. |
| "It's just a small change" | Small changes have caused large outages. The size of the change does not determine the importance of the message. |
| "Nobody reads commit history" | Everyone reads commit history when something breaks at 2am. |

## Verification

Before confirming a commit message:

- [ ] Type is one of the allowed values
- [ ] Subject is lowercase and imperative
- [ ] Subject is ≤150 characters
- [ ] Body (if present) explains *why*, not *what*
- [ ] Issue reference present if applicable
- [ ] Co-Authored-By footer present
- [ ] Staged changes represent a single logical unit
- [ ] If adding N independent units, N+1 commits are planned
- [ ] PR (if open) describes a single concern — passes the "no and" test
- [ ] PR has assignee set
- [ ] PR has at least one area label and one priority label
- [ ] PR is assigned to the correct milestone
- [ ] PR is added to the active project board
